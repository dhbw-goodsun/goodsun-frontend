Configuration for the backend can be changed under `/src/environments/environment.ts` and `..environment.prod.ts`.


### SSL encryption for local testing
This Application need SSL-encryption (https). 

#### Generating self signed SSL-Certificates (openssl)

Then execute (while in the same directionary) `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -config san.cnf`

To verify use `openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout`. Execute `openssl x509 -outform der -in cert.pem -out cert.crt` to create Windows-useable .crt file.

#### Useage within Angular
Add following to angular.json:

"serve": {
    ...
    "options": {
        "sslKey": "key.pem",
        "sslCert": "cert.pem",
